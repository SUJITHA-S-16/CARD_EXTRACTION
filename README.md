## BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with OCR
## Statement
Developing a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information should include the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,
and pin code. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).

## Technologies used
1.OCR
2.Streamlit GUI
3.SQL 
4.Data Extraction

## Approach
1. Install the required packages: You will need to install Python, Streamlit,
easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL.
2. Design the user interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface using
Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business
card image and extracting its information. You can use widgets like file
uploader, buttons, and text boxes to make the interface more interactive.

3. Implement the image processing and OCR: Use easyOCR to extract the
relevant information from the uploaded business card image. You can use
image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to
enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.
4. Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted,
display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI. You can use
widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels to present the information.
5. Implement database integration: Use a database management system like
SQLite or MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded
business card image. You can use SQL queries to create tables, insert data,
and retrieve data from the database, Update the data and Allow the user to
delete the data through the streamlit UI
6. Test the application: Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as
expected. You can run the application on your local machine by running the
command streamlit run app.py in the terminal, where app.py is the name of
your Streamlit application file.
7. Improve the application: Continuously improve the application by adding new
features, optimizing the code, and fixing bugs. You can also add user
authentication and authorization to make the application more secure.

## Result

The result of the project would be a Streamlit application that allows users to upload
an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name,
designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin
code. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a
database along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able
to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
The final application would have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides
users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its
information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized
manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a
button.
The project would require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management. It would also require careful design and planning of the
application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
Good documentation and code organization would also be important for the project.
Overall, the result of the project would be a useful tool for businesses and individuals
who need to manage business card information efficiently.
